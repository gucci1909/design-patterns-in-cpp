# Interpreter Design Pattern - Simple House Example

## What is the Interpreter Design Pattern?

The **Interpreter Design Pattern** is a way to define a set of rules or instructions (expressions) and evaluate them step by step. It is useful when you want to describe a process or task in a structured way that can be interpreted and executed later.

### Key Points:
- It breaks a complex task into smaller, individual steps.
- Each step (or task) has a specific responsibility.
- You can combine these smaller tasks to execute a bigger operation.

## Explanation of the Example

In this example, the task is **building a house**.

1. **Individual Tasks (Expressions)**:
   - We have two tasks:
     - **Build Walls**: Adds the walls to the house.
     - **Build Roof**: Adds the roof on top of the house.
   - Each task has its own `interpret()` function, which describes how that step should be executed.

2. **Combining Tasks**:
   - The `BuildHouse` class combines these smaller tasks (walls and roof) into one sequence.
   - It processes all the steps in the correct order by interpreting each one.

3. **Execution**:
   - We interpret (process) the instructions for building the house step by step:
     - First, the walls are built.
     - Then, the roof is added.

## Definition of the Interpreter Design Pattern

The **Interpreter Design Pattern** is used to represent and evaluate language or instructions. It helps to:
- Define simple building blocks (tasks or steps).
- Combine these blocks to execute more complex operations.
- Easily modify or extend the process without changing its overall structure.
