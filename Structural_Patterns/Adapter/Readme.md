# Adapter Design Pattern

## What is the Adapter Design Pattern?
The **Adapter Design Pattern** acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces. It allows a class with an existing interface to work with another class or system that expects a different interface. The adapter "adapts" one interface to another, so they can work together.

### Definition
The **Adapter Design Pattern** is used to convert the interface of a class into another interface that the client expects. This helps make incompatible systems work together seamlessly.

## Example: House with Sockets
Imagine you have a new house that only works with modern sockets, but your appliances use old-style plugs. Instead of changing your appliances or rewiring the house, you use an adapter to connect the old plugs to the modern sockets.
