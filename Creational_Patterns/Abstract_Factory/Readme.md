# Abstract Factory Design Pattern

## What is the Abstract Factory Pattern?

The **Abstract Factory** pattern is a **creational** design pattern that allows you to create a family of related objects. You don’t have to specify the exact class of the objects to be created. The pattern provides an interface for creating objects in a way that ensures related products are created together.

In simple terms, it helps you create sets of related objects, but you don't need to know exactly how these objects are created.

## How Does It Work?

1. You have an **Abstract Factory** that declares methods for creating products.
2. Concrete factories implement these methods to create specific types of products.
3. These products are related and can be used together without any compatibility issues.

For example, if you are building a house, you might have different types of houses (like Wooden House, Steel House), and each house needs its own set of products (like doors and windows). The **Abstract Factory** ensures that each house gets its required products consistently.

## Why Use the Abstract Factory Pattern?

- It ensures that you create related objects together.
- You don’t need to worry about which exact object to create. The factory takes care of that.
- It’s useful when your application should be able to work with different families of products (e.g., wooden houses vs steel houses).

## Example in Simple Words

Imagine you are building different types of houses (wooden or steel). For each type, you need different components like doors and windows. Instead of creating the doors and windows manually every time, the **Abstract Factory** pattern allows you to create a **Wooden House Factory** and a **Steel House Factory**, each of which will automatically create the correct doors and windows for that house type.
